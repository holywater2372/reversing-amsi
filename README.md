A technical exploration of Windows AMSI.dll through reverse engineering and memory patching techniques for research. Read the full analysis on my [blog](https://holywater.dev/blog/amsi/).
# Overview
This repository contains my research on the Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), focusing on understanding its internal implementation and documenting memory patching methods used to bypass it.
Key Research Areas

Reverse engineering AMSI.dll core functions (`AmsiScanBuffer`, `AmsiScanString`)
Memory patching techniques (function hooking, return value manipulation)
